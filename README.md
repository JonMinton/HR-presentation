# HR-presentation
Presentation to and some associated materials for presentation to Hymans Robertson on 2 June 2023

In addition to the presentation itself (quite a large file), the repository contains:

- A mindmap showing the initial planning for the presentation. This is of .mm file format, and produced using the open source mindmapping software [freeplane](https://docs.freeplane.org/), a successor to freemind. 
- A qmd folder containing an example of accessing mortality data for a particular country using the HMDHFDplus R package and producing a Lexis surface using the data requested and downloaded, using Tidyverse packages including ggplot2. 
    - Note the qmd file contains a password and username for accessing the database, which is terrible practice from a security perspective! (Though the data used are hardly confidential/sensitive etc).
